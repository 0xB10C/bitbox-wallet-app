The BitBox Wallet supports building on X86_64 machines. Building on 32bit
systems is may be possible but it is explicitly unsupported. The following
platforms should be viable for development, building, and use of the BitBit
Wallet application.

* Debian GNU/Linux: Stretch and Buster
* Fedora: 26, 27, 28, and 29
* Ubuntu: 14.04, 16.04, 17.10, and 18.04
* MacOS: 10.13
* Windows: Windows 7, Windows 10

Other GNU/Linux systems should be able to run AppImage releases. Builds may
be produced with or without Docker on each supported platform.
